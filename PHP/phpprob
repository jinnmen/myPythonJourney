When trying to mv composer but /usr/bin/local shows as No such file or directory
1. echo $PATH to check whether the folder is there. If it is, just need to create a new /usr/bin/local directory.
sudo mkdir -p /usr/bin/local

Edit path permanently then recompile if laravel doesnt work. 
Notes:If you modify the $PATH variable this way, it's temporary. To change it permanently, you need to edit a specific system file and save it.
echo "export PATH=$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bashrc
