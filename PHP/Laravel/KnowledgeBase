Composer is a dependecy manager
https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-a-dependency-or-package-manager

Library - A collection of already pre-written code to make my life easier so I don't have to write everything from scratch

Package - Collection of libraries that are built on each other or using each other one way or another

Dependencies - Managing how these libraries are related to each other and which ones are essential to run the code. For example library "A" is using code from library "B" so I need both if I want to use codes from library "A".


How to remove a project from laravel?
rm -rf {{project folder name}}
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37251561/remove-delete-laravel-project

Steps to create a form:

1. To create project
#dependency manager | command to make new project| preferred distribution| laravel's framework command| Project name
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel projectname
https://appdividend.com/2018/02/01/laravel-tutorial-example-scratch/?bs-comment-added=1#Step_1_Installing_The_Laravel_Framework

2. Create new database in mysql: CREATE DATABASE dbname;

3. Edit .env file in created project folder to include dbname.

4. \q to exit mysql in command line. Then php artisan migrate to create tables users and passwordreset.

5. Make form and create_forms_table migration file.

Create a new Eloquent model class | migration file
php artisan make:model nameofmodel -m

6. Create schema for forms table in database
projectname-> database->migrations->create_forms_table
add in $table->('name'); etc.

Then php artisan migrate

7.Make a view to display the database created.
resources-> views-> can choose to put into folder (optional) -> "Name of view".blade.php

Blade {{ }} statements are automatically sent through PHP's htmlspecialchars function to prevent XSS attacks.
https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade

check forms-> create.blade.php

8. Create controller and route to display form
Php artisan command | make:controller to create a new controller | name of controller | to define as resource controller
php artisan make:controller FormController --resource

https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/controllers#resource-controllers

9. Next add the route in web.php:
Route::resource('forms','FormController');

At this step, still won't be able to view. 

Use below command to show table of connected route list (shows domain, method, URI, name, action, middleware)
php artisan route:list

Next in formcontroller.php , add into create():
@return

public function create()
{
    return view('forms.create);
}

Now the form would show.

10. Validation

In view -> create.blade.php 
add an action in:
<form method = "post" action = "{{url('forms')}}">

Add security (under post line, only add once)
{{csrf_field()}}

need to include namespace in formcontroller.php
use App\Form;

Then add validation at the same place:
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        //
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required', //normal required validation
            'email' => 'required|email|unique:ducks', //required and must be unique in ducks table
            'password' => 'reqiured',
            'password_confirm' => 'required|same:password',
        ]);

        $form = new Form();
        $form-> name = $request -> get('name');
        $form-> email = $request-> get('email');
        $form-> password = $request-> get('password');
        $form-> password_confirm = $request-> get('password_confirm');
        $form-> phonenumber = $request-> get('phonenumber');
        $form-> comments = $request-> get('comments');
        $form -> save();
        return redirect('forms')->with('success', 'Details have been added');
    }

If error, need to display. Hence add in code in create.blade.php below h2 tag in body:
			@if ($errors->any())
			<div class = "alert alert-danger"> <!-- bootstrap red alert message box-->
				<ul>
					@foreach ($errors->all() as $error)
						<li>{{ $error }}</li>
					@endforeach
				</ul>
			</div><br />
			@endif
			@if (\Session::has('success'))	
			<div class = "alert alert-success"> <!-- bootstrap green alert message box-->
				<p>{{ \Session::get('success') }}</p>
			</div><br />
			@endif
			<form method="post" action = "{{url('forms')}}"> <!-- This method attribute of the form element tells the web browser to send form data to a server. Specifying a value of POST means the browser will send the data to the web server to be processed.-->
			{{csrf_field()}}
