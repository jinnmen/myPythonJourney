Composer is a dependecy manager
https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-a-dependency-or-package-manager

Library - A collection of already pre-written code to make my life easier so I don't have to write everything from scratch

Package - Collection of libraries that are built on each other or using each other one way or another

Dependencies - Managing how these libraries are related to each other and which ones are essential to run the code. For example library "A" is using code from library "B" so I need both if I want to use codes from library "A".
