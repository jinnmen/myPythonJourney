Modern Data Scientists needs to have 3 main skills:
i) Computer Science: Algorithms
ii) Statistics: Inference, Bayesian Statistics, Probability modeling, probability theory.
iii) Optimization: Knowing how to optimize complicated functions with respect to their parameters.

Need domain expertise

Listening to people in real world speak. (soft skill)
Then intepreting your machine learning in such a way
that you can communicate to somebody what you've learned
by analyzing their data set.

Ability to see how problems of a domain
can be reframed as machine learning tasks.

Collaboration skills with other people
who are computational.

Data scientist needs to be able to manage
large amounts of data, need to be able to program.

Basically need to handle lots of different
programming languages, more in a scripting sense.

Need to be able to be a data munger and move data around 
from different platforms and different sources.
Need to be able to program well.
Need to process massive amounts of data.
Need to understand the techniques behind the data science algorithms.

data-literacy is the ability to consume for knowledge, produce coherently and think critically about data. Data literacy includes statistical literacy but also understanding how to work with large data sets, how they were produced, how to connect various data sets and how to interpret them.
