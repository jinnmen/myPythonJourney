How to commit to github on Cloud9
http://lepidllama.net/blog/how-to-push-an-existing-cloud9-project-to-github/

Cloud 9 introduced by Shogo Arao, implemented and pushed on 30/10/2017

Didn't add in SSH keychain into github but cloud9 seems to be able to push.

Needs to commit first before pushing change. Need to add commit message:
git commit -a
git commit -m "Commit message"

Push your changes:
git push -u origin master
