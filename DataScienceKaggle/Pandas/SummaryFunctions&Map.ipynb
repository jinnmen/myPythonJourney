**Exercise 7**: There are only so many words you can use when describing a bottle of wine. 
Is a wine more likely to be "tropical" or "fruity"? Create a `Series` counting how many times each of these two words 
appears in the `description` column in the dataset.

Hint: use a map to check each description for the string `tropical`, then count up the number of times this is `True`. 
Repeat this for `fruity`. Create a `Series` combining the two values at the end.

"""
**Exercise 8**: What combination of countries and varieties are most common?

Create a `Series` whose index consists of strings of the form `"<Country> - <Wine Variety>"`. 
For example, a pinot noir produced in the US should map to `"US - Pinot Noir"`. 
The values should be counts of how many times the given wine appears in the dataset. Drop any reviews 
with incomplete `country` or `variety` data.

Hint: you can do this in three steps. First, generate a `DataFrame` whose `country` and `variety` columns are non-null. 
Then use a map to create a series whose entries are a `str` concatenation of those two columns. 
Finally, generate a `Series` counting how many times each label appears in the dataset.
